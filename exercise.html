    <h1>Basketball</h1>
    <p>
      Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five
      players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with
      the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches
      (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46
      cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end
      of the court), while preventing the opposing team from shooting through
      their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind
      the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play
      stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is
      given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most
      points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with
      the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running
      (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require
      considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots â€“ the
      layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from
      a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense
      may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or
      backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without
      dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then
      resume dribbling.

      The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. The
      tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is
      the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small
      forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the
      shooting guard and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan
      by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player
      positioning). Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and
      one-on-one.

    <h2>Creation</h2>
    <p>
      In December 1891, James Naismith, a Canadian-American professor of
      physical education and instructor at the International Young Men's
      Christian Association Training School (now Springfield College) in
      Springfield, Massachusetts,[5] was trying to keep his gym class active on
      a rainy day.[6] He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students
      occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England
      winters. After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited
      to walled-in gymnasiums
    </p>
    <p>
      he invented a new game in which players would pass a ball to teammates and
      try to score points by tossing the ball into a basket mounted on a wall.
      Naismith wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto an elevated
      track. Naismith initially set up the peach basket with its bottom intact,
      which meant that the ball had to be retrieved manually after each "basket"
      or point scored. This quickly proved tedious, so Naismith removed the
      bottom of the basket to allow the balls to be poked out with a long dowel
      after each scored basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basketball was originally played with a soccer ball. These round balls
      from "association football" were made, at the time, with a set of laces to
      close off the hole needed for inserting the inflatable bladder after the
      other sewn-together segments of the ball's cover had been flipped
      outside-in
    </p>
    <p>
      These laces could cause bounce passes and dribbling to be
      unpredictable.[9] Eventually a lace-free ball construction method was
      invented, and this change to the game was endorsed by Naismith (whereas in
      American football, the lace construction proved to be advantageous for
      gripping and remains to this day).
    </p>
    <h2>Professional Basketball</h2>
    <p>
      Teams abounded throughout the 1920s. There were hundreds of men's
      professional basketball teams in towns and cities all over the United
      States, and little organization of the professional game. Players jumped
      from team to team and teams played in armories and smoky dance halls.
      Leagues came and went. Barnstorming squads such as the Original Celtics
      and two all-African American teams, the New York Renaissance Five ("Rens")
      and the (still existing) Harlem Globetrotters played up to two hundred
      games a year on their national tours.
